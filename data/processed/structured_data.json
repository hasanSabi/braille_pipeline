      "text": "Down the Rabbit-Hole\n\n\u2018Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped\ninto the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n\u2018conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice\n\u2018without pictures or conversation?\"\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for\ntthe hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the\npleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of\ngetting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit\nwith pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think\nit'so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\" (when she thought it over\nafterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at\nthis, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the\nRabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET,\nand looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for\nit flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit\nwith either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and\nburning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and\nfortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole\nunder the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and\nthen dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.",
